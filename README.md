# symfony-4-basics
Source code for the API Platform + React.JS Course

I have updated this project to Symfony 4.4, because I need to Api Platform in the project piotr-jura-udemy/api-platform-react-js

Easyadmin for this project is not installed.

php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate 
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
